    <hr><p>CYBER SAFETY INTRODUCTION</p>
     <br>
<p>Over the past decade or so, the internet has seen a meteoric rise in coverage. In developed countries, nearly the entire populace now has access to a moderate speed internet connection either through broadband or mobile. In developing countries, too, access to the internet has started penetrating the poorest of towns and neighborhoods. Within this decade the entire world is likely to get a connection of some kind. The internet has had numerous benefits for people of all backgrounds, vocations, and demographics.
<br>
  <br>
However, as is the case with everything good, the internet has its drawbacks as well. The internet is flush with dark alleyways and corners, with unethical actors ready to pounce on the smallest opportunity they get to dupe an unknowing user. Such actors can steal your identity, important financial details, professional work, or even your passwords, and blackmail you with the information they have procured. While it is great that you can use the internet for numerous functions, the aforementioned facts also reinforce the importance of staying wary while surfing the web.

This article will explore how the internet can act to your detriment, and how you can ensure that it doesn’t by providing an introduction on Cyber Safety.</p>
    <br>
    <br>

<p>The field that deals with staying safe on the internet is known as Cyber Safety. There are numerous reasons why you should know the meaning of Cyber Safety. First and foremost, as more and more people have been gaining access to the internet, the need for educating them about Cyber Safety has also increased. This has made Cyber Safety a budding professional avenue as well. Additionally, learning about Cyber Safety is likely to teach you several new things and change how you surf the internet.</p>
    <br>

With that, let’s get started with our journey through Cyber Safety.

It can often be hard to define Cyber
  <br>   
    <br>
    Safety or provide a concrete meaning of Cyber Safety. Cyber Safety is not a rigid field in its own right, but rather a collection of steps and measures. Hence, Cyber Safety can be defined as a set of measures meant to promote the safe usage of the internet and prevent exposure to internet malware, fraud, or theft.
    <br>
<br>
2. WHY IS CYBER SAFETY IMPORTANT?
The importance of Cyber Safety cannot be understated. Why is Cyber Safety important? It is important because it concerns anyone with even the slowest connection to the internet. Anyone can be exposed to internet fraud, and malware is present at more locations on the internet than you can imagine. Learning about Cyber Safety helps us understand how these different types of cyber attacks can impact use, and what measures can we take to defend ourselves against it. Making the entire internet user community aware of Cyber Safety measures and keeping them updated with the pitfalls and risks they are exposed to may be a constructive step to curb cyber crime.
<br>
    <br>
3. WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF CYBER ATTACKS?
A cyber attack is an umbrella term for many different types of attacks that can occur online. These attacks can counter your identity, your financial information, for online accounts, and much more. All things considered, the major types of cyber attacks can be divided into four broad sections.

Malware
Identity Theft
Cyber Bullying
Plagiarism
<br>
    <br>

WHAT IS CYBER BULLYING?
Cyberbullying refers to the usage of the internet and related sources to cause deliberate harm to people. Like the other types of cyber attack mentioned in the list above, cyberbullying can also take several forms. The most frequent form of cyberbullying is known as flaming. Flaming refers to the usage of angry and hostile language publicly on the internet. This is mostly found on social media websites and internet forums. Another form of cyberbullying is online harassment. Online harassment is much like flaming, but is generally unilateral and restricted to private messages. This entails the receipt of insulting or even threatening messages through email or private messages on social websites.

Another type of cyberbullying is denigration or dissing, in which a person is unilaterally condemned on social media by another person or group of persons. Impersonation is a type of cyberbullying in which one person pretends to be another. This is different from identity theft since the other person does not break into your account, but rather makes another account in your name. Outing and trickery are forms of cyberbullying in which someone publicly reveals private information, images, or messages you had trusted them with.

<br>
    <br>

WHAT IS PLAGIARISM?
Plagiarism is a widely acknowledged concept, but not many know that it also comes under a cyber threat category. Plagiarism occurs when someone takes your work and then misappropriates it as their own. At the same time, anyone can be prone to committing an act of plagiarism. This is because a significant majority of people are never taught the value of citing someone else’s work when you use it. We tend to take the internet as a free resource and believe that all information on the internet can be used freely. It is not so. If the purpose you are using someone else’s work is not internal or private, it is always wise to cite your source.

    <h2>CONCLUSION:</h2>
Cyber Safety is not just an important concept to learn, but also very important to educate others about. Staying safe and careful on the internet is important since it is the one place after our homes that we spend the greatest amount of time. The above mentioned cyber threats and ways of averting them must always be taken into consideration. Be it a malware, or identity theft, an instance of cyber bullying or plagiarism, cyber crimes can potentially ruin your professional image and interfere with the peace of your mind. So pay heed to all the Cyber Safety measures, as it is better to be safe than sorry.

    <p>Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.

·        Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
        <br>
        <br>

·        Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.
<br>
        <br>
·        Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.
<br>
        <br>
·        Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.
<br>
        <br>
·        Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources.
<br>
        <br>
·        End-user education addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.
<br>
      <br>

      
Types of cyber threats
The threats countered by cyber-security are three-fold:


1. Cyber-attack often involves politically motivated information gathering.
<br>
        <br>
2. Cyberterrorism is intended to undermine electronic systems to cause panic or fear.
<br>
        <br>
So, how do malicious actors gain control of computer systems? Here are some common methods used to threaten cyber-security:

Malware
Malware means malicious software. One of the most common cyber threats, malware is software that a cybercriminal or hacker has created to disrupt or damage a legitimate user’s computer. Often spread via an unsolicited email attachment or legitimate-looking download, malware may be used by cybercriminals to make money or in politically motivated cyber-attacks.

There are a number of different types of malware, including:
<br>
        <br>
·        Virus: A self-replicating program that attaches itself to clean file and spreads throughout a computer system, infecting files with malicious code.
<br>
        <br>
·        Trojans: A type of malware that is disguised as legitimate software. Cybercriminals trick users into uploading Trojans onto their computer where they cause damage or collect data.
<br>
        <br>
·        Spyware: A program that secretly records what a user does, so that cybercriminals can make use of this information. For example, spyware could capture credit card details.
<br>
        <br>
·        Ransomware: Malware which locks down a user’s files and data, with the threat of erasing it unless a ransom is paid.
<br>
        <br>
·        Adware: Advertising software which can be used to spread malware.
<br>
        <br>
·        Botnets:Networks of malware infected computers which cybercriminals use to perform tasks online without the user’s permission.

SQL injection
An SQL (structured language query) injection is a type of cyber-attack used to take control of and steal data from a database. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in data-driven applications to insert malicious code into a databased via a malicious SQL statement. This gives them access to the sensitive information contained in the database.

Phishing
Phishing is when cybercriminals target victims with emails that appear to be from a legitimate company asking for sensitive information. Phishing attacks are often used to dupe people into handing over credit card data and other personal information.
<br>
        <br>
Denial-of-service attack
A denial-of-service attack is where cybercriminals prevent a computer system from fulfilling legitimate requests by overwhelming the networks and servers with traffic. This renders the system unusable, preventing an organization from carrying out vital functions.

Latest cyber threats
What are the latest cyber threats that individuals and organizations need to guard against? Here are some of the most recent cyber threats that the U.K., U.S., and Australian governments have reported on.
<br>
        <br>
Dridex malware
In December 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) charged the leader of an organized cyber-criminal group for their part in a global Dridex malware attack. This malicious campaign affected the public, government, infrastructure and business worldwide.

Dridex is a financial trojan with a range of capabilities. Affecting victims since 2014, it infects computers though phishing emails or existing malware. Capable of stealing passwords, banking details and personal data which can be used in fraudulent transactions, it has caused massive financial losses amounting to hundreds of millions.

In response to the Dridex attacks, the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre advises the public to “ensure devices are patched, anti-virus is turned on and up to date and files are backed up”.

<br>
        <br>

The FBI reports that romance cyber threats affected 114 victims in New Mexico in 2019, with financial losses amounting to $1.6 million.

Emotet malware
In late 2019, The Australian Cyber Security Centre warned national organizations about a widespread global cyber threat from Emotet malware.

Emotet is a sophisticated trojan that can steal data and also load other malware. Emotet thrives on unsophisticated password: a reminder of the importance of creating a secure password to guard against cyber threats.</p>
